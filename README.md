## Introduction
To gain a better understanding of the crime in my hometown as well as exercise my data engineering skills, I created a simple pipeline to extract, transform, and load public crime data into a locally hosted database to query. The Oakland Police Department provides crime data from the past 90-days to the public through the City of Oaklandâ€™s Crime Watch web site. The dataset can be programmatically accessed via the Socrata Open Data API.
